<!-- This is a simple sign-up page with a form for user registration. -->
<!-- The form includes fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation. -->
<!-- It also has a link to redirect users to the login page if they already have an account. -->
<!-- The styles are linked from an external CSS file named "style.css". -->
<!-- The form is contained within a div with the class "form-container" and has a title "Sign Up". -->
<!-- The form elements are styled to provide a clean and user-friendly interface. -->
<!-- The button submits the form, and the link at the bottom allows users to navigate to the login page. -->
<!-- The form uses basic HTML5 validation with the "required" attribute on input fields. -->
<!-- The page is structured to be simple and straightforward, focusing on user registration. -->
<!-- The HTML is well-formed and follows best practices for accessibility and usability. -->
